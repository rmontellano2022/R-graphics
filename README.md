# R Graphics

This is the repository for D-Lab's introductory Python-Fundamentals workshop series. Laptop, Internet connection, and Zoom account required.

This workshop will provide an introduction to graphics in R with ggplot2. Participants will learn how to construct, customize, and export a variety of plot types in order to visualize relationships in data. We will also explore the basic grammar of graphics, including the aesthetics and geometry layers, adding statistics, transforming scales, and coloring or panelling by groups. You will learn how to make histograms, boxplots, scatterplots, lineplots, and heatmaps. You will also learn how to facet plots and create compound figures. 

**Prior experience with R is assumed such as R-Fundamentals Parts 1 through 4 or equivalent knowledge.**

# Installation Instructions

In preparation for the upcoming workshop you will need to install R, RStudio, the necessary packages, and the workshop materials.

**1. Install R**

Download R by clicking the link here: https://cloud.r-project.org/

Select your operating system and then click "base" (Windows users) or "R-4.0.3.pkg". Double-click this file once it has finished downloading and follow the instructions to install it.

**2. Install RStudio**

Download RStudio by visiting this link: https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/

Scroll down and click the Download button beneath "RStudio Desktop - Open Source License - Free". Double-click this file once it has finished downloading and follow the instructions to install it.

**3. Install the necessary packages**

Install the ggplot2 packages by installing the tidyverse
install.packages(“tidyverse”)

Or, just install ggplot2
install.packages(“ggplot2”)

**4. Download the workshop materials**

Download the workshop materials by visiting the GitHub repository: https://github.com/dlab-berkeley/R-graphics 

To download the repository, click the green button in the top right hand corner that says "Code" and then select "Download ZIP". You can then unzip the contents of the downloaded folder somewhere accessible on your local computer (we recommend your Desktop).

We will take a few minutes at the start of the workshop to make sure everyone has R and RStudio installed and the workshop materials downloaded. Please feel free to email dlab-frontdesk@berkeley.edu or visit our help desk at https://dlab.berkeley.edu/frontdesk if you have any questions.

NOTE: D-Lab workshops normally start 10 minutes after the scheduled start time (“Berkeley Time”). We recommend you log on at the start time to join the waiting room where hosts will message you further information.

# About the UC Berkeley D-Lab

D-Lab works with Berkeley faculty, research staff, and students to advance data-intensive social science and humanities research. Our goal at D-Lab is to provide practical training, staff support, resources, and space to enable you to use R for your own research applications. Our services cater to all skill levels and no programming, statistical, or computer science backgrounds are necessary. We offer these services in the form of workshops such as R Fundamentals, one-to-one consulting, and working groups that cover a variety of research topics, digital tools, and programming languages.  

Visit the [D-Lab homepage](http://dlab.berkeley.edu/) to learn more about us. View our [calendar](http://dlab.berkeley.edu/calendar-node-field-date) for upcoming events, and also learn about how to utilize our [consulting](http://dlab.berkeley.edu/consulting) and [data](http://dlab.berkeley.edu/data-resources) services.
